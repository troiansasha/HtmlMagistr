                     Bitcoin (BTC) looks set to end April in the green for the fourth consecutive year, having confirmed a longer-term bull breakout earlier this month.The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at <span class="red">$5,200</span> on Bitstamp, representing a 27 percent gain on the month’s opening price of <span class="orange">$4,092.</span> BTC previously rallied 8, 26, and 33 percent in the fourth month of 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The sharp rise seen this month seems to have put the bulls in a commanding position for a long haul. The cryptocurrency has violated the most basic of all bearish technical patterns – the lower highs, lower lows – with a convincing move above <span class="orange">$4,236.</span>
